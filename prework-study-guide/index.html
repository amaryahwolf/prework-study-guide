        <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML gives content structure</li>
        <li>the head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly; the elements included are not visisble when a user looks at a webpage</li>
        <li>the body element contains the content that is shown to the user; all the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element</li>
        <li>declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensistive</li>
        <li>an HTML attribute defines additional information about an element; e.g. html lang="en" means the we language for the webpage is english</li>
        <li>there are lots of metadata tags to learn that u can use inside the head element</li>
        <li>title defines the title for a webpage and is important for SEO</li>
        <li>style defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
        <li>base defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
        <li>link connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
        <li>meta defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport</li>
        <li>script embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
        <li>charset is the character set</li>
        <li>!DOCTYPEhtml tells us the document is written in HTML</li>
        <li>http-equiv sets an HTTP header for content</li>
        <li>viewport sets the default view for our webpage</li>
        <li>parent/child element - the body element is the parent and 3+ elements nestled inside the body is the child</li>
        <li>semantic HTML elements: the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
        <li>div creates a division on the page</li>
        <li>span creates an inline division</li>
        <li>the opening tag and closing tag contain the contents of the visible HTML elements; closing tag has a forward slash</li>
        <li>note: an element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag; a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
        <li>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 are headings; u can only have one h1 on a webpage; this is important for screen readers</li>
        <li>p is a paragraph or block of text</li>
        <li>ul creates an unordered list</li>
        <li>ol creates an ordered list</li>
        <li> creates listed items</li>
        <li>img contains information about images displayed on a webpage and can contain various attributes; e.g. src attribute defines the location of the image & alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image - also important for screen readers and assistvie technologies</li>
        <li>br creates a line of empty space or a line break between two blocks of content</li>
        <li>a stands for anchor and creates links to the same webpage or other webpages; href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
        <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css=section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>inline CSS:  style an element directly in the HTML file; useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
        <li>internal style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file; a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements; uses style element</li>
        <li> external style sheet: (most common way to style a webpage) allows devs to keep all CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier; uses link element</li>
        <li>declaration: contains the CSS property and value of the property</li>
        <li>margin (property): indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>padding (property): adds space around the content inside an element; increasing padding makes the entire element bigger</li>
        <li>asterisk: wild card symbol: declares that ALL elements on the page will have the same style properties</li>
        <li>can combine 2 selectors (e.g. header and footer) into a single CSS rule with a comma .. helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code; can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase</li>
        <li>text-align: positioning property</li>
        <li>img: applies rule to image</li>
        <li>display:block = assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
        <li>when we create an externall CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file; use the HTML link element</li>
        <li>link element creates the connection to the external file</li>
        <li>rel attribute specifies the relatinoship between the current doc and linked doc</li>
        <li>href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
        <li>.card designates a class selector; any HTML element assigned to the class will gain those property assignments</li>
        <li>can assign colors using semantic references (e.g. gray or blue) or by a hexadecimal code or hex #</li>
